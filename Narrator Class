/* 
    The narrator class should describe interactive objects (sprites), status of players and
    enemies, and describe moves and items. Methods for such should be placed and
    fixed/finished later.

    While the narrator is describing an interactive object, the player should be
    unable to move until they confirm the information has been received (available
    after the narrator is done speaking).
